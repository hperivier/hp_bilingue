#### Courses for the academic year 2022-2023 at Sciences Po, Paris campus

The images that illustrate each course were drawned by Kaća Bradonjić during scientific conferences she has attended to. To see more -\> [Projections -- Kaća Bradonjić (kacabradonjic.com)](http://kacabradonjic.com/projections/). The illustration of "*L'économie au défi du genre*" was drawn while I was presenting the paper [« Women and the Language of Statistics in Late-Nineteenth-Century France: Reading the Graphs of Madame Pégard »](pdf/pegard.pdf) at the Wellesley college in 2017 -\> many thanks Kaća!
