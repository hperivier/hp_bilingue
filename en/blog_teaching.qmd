The painting associated to the course "L'économie au défi du genre" was drawn while I was presenting the paper [« Women and the Language of Statistics in Late-Nineteenth-Century France: Reading the Graphs of Madame Pégard »](pdf/pegard.pdf) at the Wellesley college in 2017. I was so proud that my talk has been such an inspiration for Kaća, many thanks to her!
