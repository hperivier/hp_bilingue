### Course description

##### Teaching Assistant : Hazal Atay

All societies are characterized by sex inequalities. Economic and social organizations rely on a sexual division of labor based on social norms which assign different roles for men and women; these categories must be questioned through the lens of gender. The course introduces a gender perspective in social sciences with a specific focus on economics. The persistence of sex inequalities articulated with other types of inequalities (social class, ethnicity ...) are analyzed by relying on theoretical and empirical knowledge. A broad spectrum of topics is addressed that enlighten the importance of gender in the understanding of our societies and their sustainability: questioning categories and concepts (gender, sex etc.); theories of justice and gender; presentation of feminist economics; the economic history of sexual division of labor; measuring discriminations and inequalities in the labor market; analyzing the gender dimension of crisis (great recession and covid19 crisis); gender and economic development; ecological sustainability and feminism. The interactions between Welfare state (public policies), market (labor market in particular) and family are analyzed through international, historical, and socio-economic perspectives. The course builds bridges between academic knowledge and policy making, in this regard the evaluation of public policies is covered. A particular attention is paid to controversies within the academic sphere to shed light on the inherent complexities in tackling inequalities and discriminations. Discussions based on mandatory readings are opened in the class. Some guests can be invited to share their latest research to broaden the scope of the course.

#### **SESSION 4: On Feminist Economics**

From a political perspective, feminist economics focuses on what is needed to produce a gender equal society, by raising issues that matter for feminism. From an epistemological perspective, It argues that because modern economics was built around the idea of the "economic man", it is affected by an androcentric bias, and this affects its scientific dimension.

#### **SESSION 8: Analyzing and tackling discriminations**

Discriminations produce inequalities but all forms of inequalities do not result from discriminations. From a legal point of view, discrimination process is defined as an unequal treatment of individuals based on criteria that are prohibited by law (sex, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation ....). New concepts and approaches of discrimination have been developed to integrate more complex processes such as indirect discrimination, multiples discriminations and systemic discriminations. Measuring discriminations is a first step to tackle them. What are the different policies implemented to tackle discrimination? Are they efficient? What is the power of law?

**SESSION 9: Crisis and gender: from Great recession to the covid-19 crisis**

What do we learn from the great recession? The economic crisis experienced by European countries in 2009 has led to pipeline of low economic growth, high level of unemployment, increase in poverty and a crisis of public debt. In the aftermath of the crisis, austerity policies have been implemented in most European countries to achieve fiscal consolidation. Those economics policies are gender blind but not gender neutral. The session analyses the consequence of the crisis and question the business cycle in a gender perspective. The covid 19 crisis has shed light on structural gender inequalities.

#### **SESSION 10: Gender and economic development**.

International institutions (UN, OECD, IMF, World Bank...) promote gender equality as tool to boost the economic development of poor countries. Education of girls, microcredits for women create female "empowerment", and would increase the GDP of these countries. The gender perspective in economic development has been integrated progressively. This session proposes a critical analysis of these approaches and sheds light on the empirical literature on poverty, gender, and economic growth.

#### **SESSION 11: Capitalism, neoliberalism, and gender**

Capitalism is the dominant economic model worldwide. Is it compatible with gender equality? Does Capitalism cope with class, race and sex inequalities or does it create them? Sharing the economic power, quota, and law: what results in terms of gender equalities? Gender equality and/or diversity is more and more used or presented as a lever to increase economic performance (productivity, wealth, and better functioning of organizations...). How and why does this perspective jeopardize gender equality as a concept and as an achievement?

#### **SESSION 12: Sustainability, ecology and feminism.**

Does an ecological approach reinforce the identification of women with nature? Can dualistic thinking about men and women, humans and nature be replaced with a fuller picture of human identity and knowledge? To what extend the commons/communing provides an alternative to the private and public ownership that can produce gender equality?
